I did all my data mining assignments in Scala. I cannot post them online due to academic integrity policy.

Below is the list of some of the assignments done on the YELP dataset(small, large and very large)-
1. Collabrative Filtering - User Based and Model Based
2. Frequent Itemsets - SON Algorithm
3. Twitter Streaming - Get top 10 hastags in a time period
