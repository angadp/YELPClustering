# YELPClustering
The goal is to apply clustering on YELP dataset. We are applying 3 methos - K Means, Hierarchial Clusterinig and CURE Algorithm.

K Means - k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that is popular for cluster analysis in data mining. k-means clustering aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells. 

Hierarchical Clusterinig - In data mining and statistics, hierarchical clustering (also called hierarchical cluster analysis or HCA) is a method of cluster analysis which seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters.

CURE (Clustering Using REpresentatives) is an efficient data clustering algorithm for large databases[citation needed]. Compared with K-means clustering it is more robust to outliers and able to identify clusters having non-spherical shapes and size variances.
